- **Streamlit app:** `streamlit_app.py` (run with `pip install -r requirements.txt && streamlit run streamlit_app.py`)
- The Streamlit app requires sign-up / log-in. Accounts are stored in a local SQLite file (`users.db`, passwords hashed with PBKDF2). On Streamlit Community Cloud this file is not persistent, so accounts may reset when the app restarts.
- **Static web version (no login):** open `index.html` in a browser (uses `grading.js`, `app.js`, `style.css`)

Pass rule: at least 40% in every subject and overall.
Grades: A+ ≥90 · A ≥80 · B+ ≥70 · B ≥60 · C ≥50 · D ≥40 · F <40
